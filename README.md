## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- POST /api/auth/register - Register a new user
- POST /api/auth/login - Login user

### Tasks
- GET /api/tasks - Get all tasks (with filtering & sorting)
- POST /api/tasks - Create a new task
- PUT /api/tasks/:id - Update a task
- DELETE /api/tasks/:id - Delete a task
- GET /api/tasks/leaderboard - Get user leaderboard

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a .env file based on .env.example and fill in your details:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/task-management
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
   NODE_ENV=development
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Technical Evaluation

### Code Quality and Structure

#### Architecture
- **Service Layer Pattern**
  - Separation of concerns with dedicated services for auth, tasks, and file uploads
  - Business logic isolated from controllers
  - Improved maintainability and testability

#### Best Practices
- ES6+ features
- Async/await for promise handling
- Error handling middleware
- Input validation
- Environment configuration
- Consistent code style

### API Design and Efficiency

#### RESTful Endpoints Documentation

##### Create Task
```http
POST /api/tasks
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

{
  "title": "Task Title",
  "description": "Task Description",
  "priority": "High",
  "dueDate": "2023-12-31",
  "image": <file>
}
```

##### Get Tasks (with filtering & sorting)
```http
GET /api/tasks
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Query Parameters:
- status: Task status (To Do, In Progress, Completed)
- priority: Task priority (Low, Medium, High)
- startDate: Filter tasks from this date
- endDate: Filter tasks until this date
- search: Search in title and description
- sortBy: Field to sort by (createdAt, dueDate, priority)
- sortOrder: Sort order (asc, desc)
- page: Page number for pagination
- limit: Number of items per page
- assignedTo: Filter by assigned user ID
- createdBy: Filter by creator user ID
```

### Security Implementation

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Token expiration
- Protected routes middleware
- Role-based access control (Admin/User)
- Resource ownership validation

#### Data Security
- Input sanitization
- Request validation
- Secure file upload handling
- Environment variable protection

### Database Design

#### Schema Design
```javascript
// User Schema
{
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String,
  role: String,
  completedTasks: Number,
  totalTasks: Number
}

// Task Schema
{
  title: String,
  description: String,
  status: String,
  priority: String,
  dueDate: Date,
  creator: ObjectId,
  assignedTo: ObjectId,
  imageUrl: String
}
```

#### Optimization
- Compound indexes for filtering
- Text indexes for search
- Efficient pagination
- Proper population of references

### Image Upload System

#### Cloudinary Integration
- Secure file upload
- Image optimization
- CDN delivery
- Automatic format optimization
- File type validation
- Size limits
- Automatic cleanup

### Testing Coverage
